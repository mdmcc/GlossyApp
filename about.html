            <pre>  Glossy is a mobile application that can be used to order mobile hair services directly to your location! Instead of having to go to an on-site hair stylists you can have the hair stylist come directly to where ever is most convenient for you. All you have to do is input what type of service you would like done, where you would like to have it done and what date and time are best for you. This information goes into our database and shows your appointment as an option for any number of hair stylists. The hair stylists will go through a list of potential appointments and confirm the ones that they would like to perform. Once your appointment is confirmed you get a notification and thats all there is to it!
