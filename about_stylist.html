                <pre> Glossy is an application that is a tool for mobile hair stylists to engage and meet new customers! The customers will input their appointment data including where they want the appointment to be, what services they would like done and what time and date they want their appointment to be at. This information is fed into our database and will come up in your calender as one of many potential appointments that you cna pick from. Once you have read over the appointment information and made sure that it matches up with your skill set and schedule all you have to do is hit confirm! This takes the appointment out of the running for any other stylists and you have an appointment ready to go!
